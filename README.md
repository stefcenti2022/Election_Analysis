# Colorado BOE Congressional Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
This project provides an analysis of a recent congressional election requested by the Colorado Board of Elections. The results of this analysis completes the audit for the election.

Election data comes from 3 primary methods:
1. Mail-In Ballots
2. Punch Cards
3. Direct Recording Electronic or DRE counting machines

Once the data is collected in the proper format it can be read by this program to provide an analysis of 
other elections as well.  

For this analysis, the total number of votes cast, the counties included in the election, the percentage of votes cast for each county, the winner of the election among other useful information described in detail in the results section of this report.
